          <b>Jewellery</b> (or jewelry in American English) consists of
          <mark>decorative</mark> items worn for personal adornment, such as
          brooches, rings, necklaces, earrings, pendants, bracelets, and
          cufflinks. Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes. From
          a western perspective, the term is restricted to durable ornaments,
          excluding flowers for example. For many centuries metal such as gold
          often combined with gemstones, has been the normal material for
          jewellery, but other materials such as glass, shells and other plant
          materials may be used.

          <u>Jewellery</u> may be made from a wide range of materials.
          <i>Gemstones</i> and similar materials such as amber and coral,
          precious metals, beads, and shells have been widely used, and enamel
          has often been important. In most cultures <u>jewellery</u> can be
          understood as a status symbol, for its material properties, its
          patterns, or for meaningful symbols. Jewellery has been made to adorn
          nearly every body part, from hairpins to toe rings, and even genital
          jewellery. In modern European culture the amount worn by adult males
          is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in
          European culture.

          In creating jewellery, gemstones, coins, or other precious items are
          often used, and they are typically set into precious metals.
          <mark>Platinum</mark> alloys range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95%
          pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually sterling silver, or
          92.5% fine silver. In costume jewellery, stainless steel findings are
          sometimes used.
